Express has the ability, to identify different expressions
in routing in different ways:-

1) Only slash(/) for home page
Ans) start with slash and ending with slash ==>  ^/$

2) then ==> |

3) directory with extention as an option inde.html
Ans) /index(.html)?

4)Handle redirect

5)Routing handlers --> callback/anonymous functions

6)next()--> help us to move to next function handler/callback/anonymous
